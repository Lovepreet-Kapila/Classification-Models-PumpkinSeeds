Classification Models: Pumpkin Seed Varieties

This project demonstrates classification of pumpkin seed varieties using:
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)

I use PCA for dimensionality reduction and visualize decision boundaries. Feature importance is analyzed using Random Forests.
